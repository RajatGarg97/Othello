###OTHELLO


Hola guys!! I have created a small game named Othello, also called Reversi.

This is a multiplayer game and requires at least two players. 

This game is entirely programmed in Java and the only prerequisite to play this game

is to have Java installed on your machine.


##HOW TO PLAY


The above shown image is of the game after running the code.

Its Blacks turn by default and the blue squares are the possible moves Black can make.

After Black makes a move the blue squares disappear and red ones appear. Now its White's chance 

to make a move and reds are the possible moves White can make. 

The aim of the player in this game is to make maximum squares of the colour he/she is playing for.

The game terminates when there are no possible moves for both the colours.
